About dist-tool-plugin
=====

The dist-tool-plugin checks that Maven release rules are well applied across every artifact.

Results are displayed in 2 reports:

* [Disttool> Sites][1] report, for checks about sites associated to artifacts,

* [Disttool> Source Release][2] report, for checks about artifacts source release publication.

This is [Work In Progress][3]...

Notice that this plugin is actually intended for Maven itself only: if interest is expressed to use it
in other context, it would require more configurations.

        <title>Commons Gpg Plugin: Overview</title>

        <section name="Apache Commons Gpg Plugin">

            <p>
            This is a <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven 2.x</a> Plugin which is designed
            to be used in release profiles for packages such as source and binary archives.
            </p>
            <p>
            It is an extension of the standard 
            <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-gpg-plugin/">Maven Gpg Plugin</a> that can generate signatures for
            any specified files (not just ones that are attached to the project).
            It is hoped that the functionality will eventually be added to the Maven plugin,
            at which point this plugin will become redundant.
            </p>
            <p>
            Note: the signing is done using the same code as Maven Gpg Plugin 1.4; the same properties
            and configuration items are supported. In addition, this plugin supports includes/excludes,
            see below.
            </p>
            <p>
            As with the Maven Gpg Plugin, it is assumed that the user has installed and configured GnuPG or GnuPG2
            on their system.
            </p>

        <section name="Plugin Goals">
            <p>
            Available Goals:
            <ul>
                <li>commons-gpg:signfiles - generate gpg signatures of specified files</li>
                <li>commons-gpg:help - display the plugin help as per help:describe</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Trying out the plugin">
            <p>
            Configure the plugin in the <code>&lt;build&gt;</code> section of the <code>pom.xml</code>
<source><![CDATA[
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
  <artifactId>commons-gpg-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
  <configuration>
    <includes>
      <include>target/releases/*.zip</include>
      <include>target/releases/*.tar.gz</include>
    </includes>
    <excludes> <!-- Optional -->
      <exclude>target/release/README*</exclude>
    </excludes>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>signfiles</goal>
      </goals>
      <!-- must run after assembly and before deploy -->
      <phase>verify</phase>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
]]></source>
            </p>
            <p>
            The list of files to process can also be specified on the command line:
<pre>
mvn commons-gpg:signfiles -Dgpg.files={comma-separated list of files}
</pre>
            Note that the configuration items (apart from includes/excludes) are also supported as
            properties with the prefix "gpg.".

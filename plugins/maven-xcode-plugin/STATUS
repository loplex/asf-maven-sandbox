This plugin is still experimental and only partially functional.
The mojo has only been tested with trivial projects created by archetype:create
and with XCode 2.4.1.

To use:

$ mvn install

and then

$ cd your-project
$ mvn xcode:xcode


The xcode:xcode mojo will create (if necessary) a your-project.xcodeproj
directory containing project.pbxproj and default.pbxuser.  The mojo will write
the files in the XML Property List Serialization, XCode 2.4.1
will immediately rewrite the file in the old-style serialization.

The following issues are known to exist:

Bugs:

Groups are displayed in red (assume that is an indication that something
is wrong).


Todos:

Manifests are not incorporated into the generated jars.

Really kludgy code is used to determine the absolute path
for the dependencies.  I don't know Maven internals
to do any better.

xcode:xcode hard codes executable to launch as junit.swingui.TestRunner.
XCode apparently has JUnit integration, but I've never seen how to set it up.
Any working directory set in surefire is not propagated to XCode project.

Multiple source code or resource trees are not supported, or at
least not tested.

Paths containing whitespaces have not been tested.

XCode 3.0 has not been tested.  I can't do that until Leopard is released,
but maybe others have access.

Source Code Repository integration.

Web, EAR, EJB modules.

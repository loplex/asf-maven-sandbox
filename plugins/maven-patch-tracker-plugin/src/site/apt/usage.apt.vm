Usage

 Some brief examples on how to use this plugin.

* Generate a diff from the project and load the issue to a new (or update) issue in your issue tracker.

  All scm supported by {{{http://maven.apache.org/scm}Apache Maven Scm}} are supported for generate a diff/patch.

  <<Note>>: The only target supported system is jira. (feature to come: reviewboard)

  Most of the parameters can be configured in the mojo or with cli (see below for easy configuration).

  <<Note>>: if you don't use non interactive mode (-B), Maven will ask you some questions.

  So hack on the project and simply use :

+---------
mvn patch-tracker:create -Dpatch.summary="foo summary" -B
// the scm declared in the pom is svn but you use git svn add the parameter
mvn patch-tracker:create -Dpatch.summary="foo summary" -B -Dscm.providerType=git
+---------

* Create an issue from a patch tracker.

  Get a patch/diff from your patch tracker system.

  <<Note>>: The only supported is github. (feature to come: reviewboard)

  So the plugin will simply read a pull request a create an issue in your issue tracker.

  <<Note>>: The only supported issue tracker is jira.

* Easy configuration setup (save your fingers!)

  By default if non using non interactive Maven mode (-B cli option), this plugin will ask you some questions.

    <section name="Apache Doxia Eclipse Plugin">
      <p>
        Apache Doxia Eclipse Plugin is an Eclipse plugin under development. It includes several
        new tools to support all
        <a href="http://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/index.html">Apache Doxia formats</a> in Eclipse,
        i.e. APT, Confluence, Simplified DocBook, FML, TWiki, XDOC and Xhtml.
        Moreover, it comes also with wizards.
      </p>
      <subsection name="What can Apache Doxia Eclipse Plugin do for you?">
        <p>
          This Eclipse Plugin:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Supports all Apache Doxia file formats</li>
          <li>Shows the rendering of any Apache Doxia files directly, without running <code>mvn site</code></li>
          <li>Supports color and styles highlighting in the editors</li>
          <li>Provides helpers to insert commonly used patterns in each format (bold, italic, monospace, link, table)</li>
          <li>Includes wizards for creating new Apache Doxia files</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

      <subsection name="Brief History">
        <p>
           This project was started in 2008 by Vincent Siveton (see <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/DOXIATOOLS-8">DOXIATOOLS-8</a>)
           but was never released. In August 2011, Herv√© Boutemy wanted to revive the project. Benson Margulies was willing to help
           by making a correct Maven build using OSGi and Tycho. Here we go now.

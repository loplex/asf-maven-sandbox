Usage

 The Forrestdoc Plugin generates an html-based, cross referenced version of Java source code based on
 the {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk/whiteboard/forrestdoc/}Forrestdoc project}}. The following examples describe the basic usage of the Plugin.

 To include Forrestdoc reports in your documentation, you must configure the following in the \<reporting\>
 section of your pom:

<project>
...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.forrest.whiteboard.forrestdoc</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-forrestdoc-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </reporting>

 When you execute <<<mvn site>>>, the report will be generated.

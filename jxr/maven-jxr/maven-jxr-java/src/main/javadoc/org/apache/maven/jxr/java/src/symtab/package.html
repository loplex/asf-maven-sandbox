    <h2>Symbol Table Classes</h2>

    <p>This page describes the classes used by our symbol table
    implementation.&nbsp; We present a table of all symbol table
    classes and a class diagram representing the relationships
    between these classes.</p>

    <table border="1" cellspacing="1" width="623">
      <tr>
        <td width="21%"><a href="SymbolTable.html"><font
        size="2" face="Courier New">SymbolTable</font></a></td>
        <td width="79%">This is the main class in the <tt>org.apache.maven.jxr.java.src.symtab</tt>
        package.&nbsp; It provides a list of all packages that
        have been parsed, a stack representing the current
        lexical scope, and a table of unique <tt>String</tt>s
        that have been read during the parse. &nbsp; This is the
        source of all symbol lookups; when resolving references,
        the requester asks the <tt>SymbolTable</tt> to look for a
        name, and it then searches the scope stack and the parsed
        packages to find the name.&nbsp; The <tt>SymbolTable</tt>
        also provides several methods to create instances of the
        other classes used in the symbol table package.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="21%">StringTable<font
        size="2" face="Courier New">StringTable</font></td>
        <td width="79%">When parsing a source file, the same
        strings usually occur again and again.&nbsp; Rather than
        store these <tt>String</tt>s as separate <tt>String</tt>
        instances, we store each unique <tt>String</tt> in the <tt>StringTable</tt>
        for more efficient use of memory.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="21%">JavaStack<font
        size="2" face="Courier New">Stack</font></td>
        <td width="79%">This is a <tt>java.util.Stack</tt> that
        keeps track of the nested scopes containing the current
        parse position.&nbsp; As Java constructs such as classes,
        methods and packages are recognized, the parser asks the <tt>SymbolTable</tt>
        to push a new containing scope on the stack.&nbsp; This
        stack provides an appropriate lookup mechanism for most
        names. &nbsp; When a name is read, the <tt>SymbolTable</tt>'s
        <tt>lookup</tt> method will check each scope on the stack
        (from the most-nested scope to the outermost scope) to
        see if the name is found inside that scope.</td>

        <td width="79%">This class identifies a line in a source
        file.&nbsp; It is used to store the location of
        definition for a class, interface, package, method or
        variable, and references to those constructs.</td>

        <td width="79%">Every Java construct stored in the symbol
        table is a <tt>Definition</tt>. &nbsp; This class
        provides a common base for all symbol definitions, and
        includes information such as an <tt>Occurrence</tt> to
        track the location where the symbol was defined, a list
        of references to the symbol and its name.</td>

        <td width="79%">Some symbols can actually contain
        definitions of other symbols.&nbsp; For example, a class
        can contain definitions for variables and even other
        classes.&nbsp; These types of symbols are grouped into a
        common base class called a <tt>ScopedDef</tt>.&nbsp; <tt>ScopedDef</tt>
        keeps a list of other constructs that were defined within
        it.&nbsp; <tt>ScopedDef</tt> objects are the objects that
        are stored in the scope <tt>Stack</tt> for name lookup.</td>

        is one that <tt>HasImports</tt>.&nbsp; A <tt>HasImports</tt>
        object is one that makes use of Java's import statements
        to access names in other packages.&nbsp; <tt>HasImports</tt>
        keeps a list of packages and classes that are names in
        Java import statements.&nbsp; Classes and interfaces are
        the constructs that are grouped under this base class.</td>

        <td width="79%">This is the definition of a Java
        Class.&nbsp; Classes can have a superclass (a reference
        to another <tt>ClassDef</tt>), a list of interfaces that
        it implements, and a list of other classes that extend
        it.</td>
      </tr>

        <td width="21%"><a
        href="ClassDef.html"><font

        <td width="79%">This represents a Java interface.&nbsp;
        Interfaces can have several super-interfaces, a list of
        classes that implement it, and a list of other<tt>
        InterfaceDef</tt>s that extend it.&nbsp; (Note that this
        class has been merged with <tt>ClassDef</tt> for this
        version of the cross-reference tool.)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="21%">PrimitiveDef<font
        size="2" face="Courier New">PrimitiveDef</font></td>
        <td width="79%">Java has several primitive types, such as
        int, long and boolean. &nbsp; When variables or constants
        of these types are passed to a method, widening
        conversions can be performed to make the actual
        parameters match the formal parameters of the
        method.&nbsp; This behavior is very similar to the
        process in which objects can be widened to their
        superclass type to match a formal parameter type.&nbsp;
        To take advantage of this similarity, <tt>PrimitiveDef</tt>
        is a subclass of <tt>ClassDef</tt>, and each primitive
        type is made a subclass of a primitive type to which it
        can widen.<p>Note that because method invocation is
        determined by parameter counts, these conversions are not
        used in the cross-reference tool.&nbsp; However, this
        inheritance relationship remains to demonstrate how you
        can benefit from watching for similarities in how symbols
        are handled.</p>

        classes and interfaces.&nbsp; The contents of a package
        may be spread across several files, each with the same
        &quot;package&quot; statement at the top.&nbsp; Our <tt>SymbolTable</tt>
        collects <tt>PackageDef</tt> objects into a list of all
        packages that have been parsed or referenced.&nbsp; In
        addition, <tt>PackageDef</tt> objects can be referenced

        <td width="79%">Java allows methods to have the same name
        as a variable or another method. &nbsp; The
        distinguishing features are the parameters (or lack
        thereof).&nbsp; When we find two symbols with the same
        name in a scope, we create a <tt>MultiDef</tt>, which
        contains a <tt>Vector</tt> that will keep track of all
        components that share that name.&nbsp; <tt>MultiDef</tt>
        provides lookup methods that distinguish which symbol is
        the correct symbol based on the number of parameters.</td>

    </table>

    <p>Note that in the final tool, the <tt>ClassDef</tt> and <tt>InterfaceDef</tt>
    classes were combined into one.&nbsp; In an extended
    cross-reference tool, these would remain independent classes.</p>

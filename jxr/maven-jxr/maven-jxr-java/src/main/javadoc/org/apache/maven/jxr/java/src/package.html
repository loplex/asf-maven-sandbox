      This original code comes from the defunct <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/alexandria/">Apache Jakarta Alexandria</a> project,
      and was initially based on the <a href="http://javasrc.sourceforge.net/">Javasrc</a> project.
      See the <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/alexandria-dev@jakarta.apache.org/msg04256.html">Alexandria-dev mail list</a>
      for CVS commits and see the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=1552505">Javasrc Forum</a>
      wherein nicolaken talked about a code grant to ASF.
      Since 2004, the code was maintained within <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/">Apache Forrest</a> project, as a subproject called Forrestdoc.
      During the summer 2007, the Apache Forrest Team gave to the Apache Maven Team the Forrestdoc project.
      See the <a href="http://www.nabble.com/-Proposal--decide-the-future-of-forrestdoc-tf4060050.html">Forrest thread</a> and the

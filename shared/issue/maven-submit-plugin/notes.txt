- xmlrpc plugin contains SAX classes which causes a constraints error so
  this is not generally usable until that issue is resolved. i could just make
  a patched JAR.
  
- custom field in jira for a patch or a marker in the body of the text, this
  would just require some project setup but could probably be automated.
